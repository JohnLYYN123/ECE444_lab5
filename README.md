## Pros and Cons of TDD
### Pros of TDD
1. Quality Assurance during code design: When a program is constructed with TDD, many defects and possible mistakes made
by the programmers can be detected at an early stage, which is extremely beneficial to the development team and the companies.
When a bug, for instance, is detected during the development stage, the bug can be easily fixed or prevented with low costs.
Without TDD, bugs are more likely to be deployed into the production environment, which can be detrimental to programs. If 
the bug causes fatal errors, then the fixing cost can be huge and there may be significant difficulties to resolve the issue.
2. Easier to maintain: As a majority of bugs and systematic defects can be avoided through TDD, more time can be utilized
to modify/improve the test cases or can be utilized for optimization. As more features are employed to the codebase, the
corresponding test cases can be integrated among the features, granting the team with more flexibility and more power to
detect potential bugs.

### Cons of TDD
1. False sense of security: TDD is not perfect and a lot of code planning and test cases are generated by programmers or
the testing teams. Creating a set of test cases to detect all potential bugs for a feature can be difficult. In other words,
passing all the test cases does not mean your feature is bug free, thus creating a false sense of security. Another aspect
is that if the person who is in charge of create the test cases is clueless about the functionalities and vulnerabilities of
a system, then the test cases that person created can be less effective.
